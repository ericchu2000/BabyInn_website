            Want a relaxing, comfortable, and worry-free confinement experience?
            Pregnancy in October is a great thing. The pain, blood and sweat during
            childbirth are unimaginable to ordinary people. Therefore, we understand
            how important confinement is to mothers. Only by receiving comprehensive
            and considerate care can we take care of the physical and mental health
            of all mothers. Postpartum is the weakest time for women. Confinement is
            very important. Confinement is like a reborn health. Some original
            ailments will heal without leaving traces. Postpartum confinement is a
            golden recovery period. Sloppy treatment.
